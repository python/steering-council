# Standing Delegations

This document serves as a public record of current standing delegations, the
reasons they were put in place, and the circumstances under which they may no
longer be needed.

## PyPA Delegations

Currently active packaging interoperability specifications are maintained in
the [PyPA Specifications] section in the Python Packaging User Guide and the
process for updating those specifications is documented in the [PyPA
Documentation].

These delegations are expected to stand indefinitely. Any of the standing
delegates may also be a sponsor for any packaging-related PEP, regardless
of their Python core developer status.

Standing Delegations:

- Package Distribution Metadata PEPs: Paul Moore
- Package Index Interface PEPs: Donald Stufft
