# Standing Delegations

This document serves as a public record of current standing delegations for
PEPs and other areas of authority, the reasons they were put in place, and
the circumstances under which they may no longer be needed.

## PyPA Delegations

Currently active packaging interoperability specifications are maintained in
the [PyPA Specifications] section in the Python Packaging User Guide and the
process for updating those specifications is documented in the [PyPA
Documentation].

These delegations are expected to stand indefinitely. Any of the standing
delegates may also be a sponsor for any packaging-related PEP, regardless
of their Python core developer status.

Standing PEP Delegations:

- Package Distribution Metadata PEPs: Paul Moore
- Package Index Interface PEPs: Donald Stufft

[PyPA Specifications]: https://packaging.python.org/specifications/
[PyPA Documentation]: https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/specifications/

As an exception to the process documented in PEP 1, these PEPs should
be announced/discussed in the [Packaging category] on Discourse,
instead of the PEPs category.

[Packaging category]: https://discuss.python.org/c/14

## Typing Council

The Typing Council, set up in [PEP 729](https://peps.python.org/pep-0729/),
oversees Python's type checking ecosystem as a whole. Typing PEPs are still
accepted or rejected by the Steering Council, but only after consultation
with the Typing Council, and typing-specific PEPs are expected to be sent to
the Typing Council first.

## C API Working Group

The C API Working Group (created by and defined in [PEP
731](https://peps.python.org/pep-0731/)) is a small committee of Python core
developers responsible for overseeing and coordinating the development and
maintenance of the Python C API. The Steering Council has in principle
delegated all C API design and implementation decisions to the C API WG,
although there is no standing PEP delegation (since the C API is rarely an
isolated PEP topic).

## Documentation Editorial Board

The Documentation Editorial Board (described in [PEP
732](https://peps.python.org/pep-0732/)) is in charge of the strategy,
structure, style and governance of all of Python's user-facing documentation
efforts. As with the C API WG there is no standing PEP delegation as there are
few PEPs specific to the documentation efforts, but the Editorial Board has
specific autonomy and authority as described in PEP 732.

## Discussing PEPs in Threads Listed in the `Post-History` Header

- Review the PEP's `Post-History` header for discussion threads.
- Discuss PEPs in the appropriate threads to gather community feedback and insights.
- Emphasize the importance of community feedback and discussion.
