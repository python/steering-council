These are some best practices of healthy councils and boards.

## Board members

- Focus on the Mission.
- Build a Culture of Trust.

## Three Hats, One Role at a Time

Members wear three hats:

- governance hat (acting as a unified group)
- implementation hat (acting on the board's behalf)
- volunteer hat (serve as organizational volunteers)

Yet, one can only wear one at a time. It's important to reflect on one's role and act accordingly.

## Communication with the Community

> Communication about the organization doesn't have to be formal.

- Timely sharing of information. Updates on a regular basis are helpful.
- Be receptive to questions.
- Help the next board succeed by developing onboarding tips.

## Evolve over time

> One size does not fit all boards, and boards can and should change.

> There's no single blueprint for success. ...consider their own organizations' history and values.
