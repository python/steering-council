# December 6

- The Steering Council met with Łukasz to discuss his progress and also
  introduced Ee to the meeting since Ee will be taking PSF lead on supporting
  Łukasz going forward. Łukasz updated the team on CLA work, testing Irit's PR,
  adding a new triager, and giving a keynote at the PyCode Conference.
- The Steering Council discussed the issue Jason posted about deprecating
  importlib.resources legacy API. It was decided that Brett would respond to
  the comment stating that Jason is following policy and that the SC is
  satisfied, but that the larger discussion on changing the policy should
  happen on python-dev. The group also discussed how Python's deprecation
  policy impacts users and library authors.
- The group said their goodbyes on Ewa's last day.

# December 13

- The Steering Council met with Ezio. There is no full import from BPO yet, but
  he will create one this week. The final migration is still tentatively
  scheduled for mid-January. Ezio will loop in Thomas on meetings with GitHub,
  which Ewa previously attended, or other SC members if Thomas can't make it.
- The SC prepared for a Talk Python podcast recording after the meeting.
