## 2022-06-27

* The SC met with Michael Droetboom, manager of Microsoft’s Faster CPython team,
  and talked about the challenges of having a team of full-timers working

  and handling a large amount of changes with unforeseen consequences.
* The SC discussed moving from python-dev to discuss.python.org.
* The SC discussed a request for extra privileges for the `python` GitHub
  organization, and decided that since the organization is currently not limited
  to CPython-related repos, it’s best to keep the list of owners minimal.
* The SC discussed guidelines for repositories in the python GitHub organization.
