## 2022-05-02

* The SC discussed topics brought up at the Summit:
  * Removing the GIL and switching to mimalloc

## 2022-05-09

* 4 SC members present
* The SC met with the Developer in Residence:
  * Łukasz reported on his PyCon keynote & upcoming talks in Lithuania & Dublin
  * Łukasz reported on issues with the new CLA bot
* SC members who were at PyCon reported on the conference.
* The SC discussed PEP 687 (isolating modules) and PEP 689 (Unstable C API tier), postponed decision until all members give their opinion
* The SC discussed PEP 690 (Lazy Imports), though it’s not ready for the SC yet.
  * This prompted a meta-discussion: should SC members participate in PEP discussions (and risk being misrepresented as the voice of the SC), or not (and only point out issues in the SC review)? There are differing opinions. We definitely need to be careful with wording.
* The SC discussed GIL removal. Many unsolved issues remain, no one seems to want to turn the proof of concept into PEPs and pull requests.
