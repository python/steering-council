  and Steering Council members should review it.
- SC reviewed the Developer-in-Residence job description that is left over
  from the CZI grant application. The Steering Council decided how this role
  needs to do certain analysis and capture certain metrics to determine
  where the impact will be. Ewa will update the job description.

  decided it would be removed in 3.10 as scheduled. Pablo will comment on
  the issue.
- SC discussed how to handle differences between accepted PEPs and

  cannot be reached, it should be sent to the Steering Council for review.

## January 18

  distutils should be deprecated. Brett will email Barry (who was absent

  major hold up is the load/store confusion. Brett will ask if Guido could
  join next week to discuss this.

  decided to reject it. Brett will email Barry about it and Thomas will help
  draft the response to the PEP author.

  the Document WG charter and then will send an email to the Steering
  Council for approval.
- SC briefly discussed docs on mobile and Carol stated that a lot could be
  improved with a more modern theme.

  top of next week's agenda.
- Thomas brought up PEP 651 and how quickly it was put up for SC consideration. It
  was decided that Pablo will email the author, asking them to discuss
  things more thoroughly on python-dev@ before asking the SC to pronounce on
  it.

  how the gist discussion has evolved. It was decided that Thomas would
