# Steering Council Update

Date: 2019-04-23

_Steering Council updates will be posted irregularly and as needed.
We strive to post at least once every month.  We provide these updates
to foster open and transparent communication about Steering Council
activity._

## Message from the Steering Council

Sorry we've been silent for a while!  We've all been swamped with
work, but we've been meeting regularly.  Below are some of the
outcomes of our conversations.  Many of you will be happy to hear that
we've cleared the backlog of PEPs by assigning BDFL-Delegates to
almost all outstanding PEPs.

## Mandate

This section **maps** Steering Council activity and projects to the mandates listed
in PEP 13.

### Language

> Maintain the quality and stability of the Python language and CPython interpreter

- (TODO: What to say here?  I don't believe we should list Python releases.)

### Contributors

> Make contributing as accessible, inclusive, and sustainable as possible

- Communications channels.  (TODO: Describe how/where we're planning to communicate.)

### PEPs

> Establish appropriate decision-making processes for PEPs

- Requesting a PEP review: Please file an issue on the
  `python/steering-council` repo.

- We've assigned BDFL-Delegates to a number of PEPs.  (TODO: publish the full list.)

### Interaction with PSF

> Formalize and maintain the relationship between the core team and the PSF

- The PSF Code of Conduct Workgroup is working on a revision of the CoC. Brett and Carol
  serve on the Workgroup.  (TODO: Any updates?)

- We've agreed to a panel discussion at PyCon US in Cleveland, Sunday
  morning May 5th between 9:20am and 10:00am.

### Governance

> Seek consensus among contributors and the core team before acting in a formal capacity
> Act as a "court of final appeal" for decisions where all other methods have failed.

- Established a weekly SC meeting cadence (Tuesdays 3-4pm US West Coast time).

- (TODO: Say something about the voting period updates to PEP 13?)
