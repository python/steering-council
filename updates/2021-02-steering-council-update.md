## February 01

- After more deliberation and consideration of all available information, the
  Steering Council accepted the Pattern Matching PEPs. The Steering Council
  agreed that high-quality documentation is crucial in this feature and
  therefore its presence should be required before the release. A response in
  the name of the Steering Council will be sent to python-dev addressing the
  decision and the Steering Council view of the process.

- The Steering Council discussed Debian's Python distro issues. The Steering
  Council will collect and communicate where the concerns are to the Debian
  maintainers. Thomas started a draft of the communication that the Steering
  Council will review, complete and sign-off.

## February 08

- The Steering Council started the discussion of PEP 651. It was decided that
  the group will leave this open for next week to better deliberate and
  consider more information.

- The Steering Council discussed the ongoing work on porting types in the
  standard library to heap-types and the subinterpreter-related changes. It was
  decided that through Pablo, the Steering Council will ask the core developers
  driving those changes to create an informational PEP and not to make any more
  changes in this area after beta 1, as per our general policy.

- The Steering Council discussed adding a TOML module to the standard library.
  It was decided that maintainers should write a PEP. On the topic of the
  standard library, it was agreed that the Steering Council should present at
  the PyCon US 2021 Language Summit on the future of the standard library and
  Brett is going to gather data on what PRs are tied to which module, which
  modules are imported and used the most, commit churn to help start the
  planning so we can make data-driven discussions and decisions. 

- The acceptance notice for PEP 634 will be sent from the Steering Council
  email, and Thomas will send rejection notices to other competing PEPs that
  are therefore rejected.

## February 15

[ The SC could not meet this week due to holidays in the US and Canada, and the
impossibility to find a common replacement date in the week ] 

## February 22

- The Steering Council discussed PEP 651 request and has decided to reject it.
  An email with the rationale will be sent to the author and python-dev.

- Ezio joined the Steering Council meeting today to give an update on the
  GitHub Migration. GitHub was dormant during the holiday months. Ezio and GH
  had a productive meeting a couple of weeks ago. He is working on the tool
  that will convert bpo issues into a format that the GH tool will accept. He
  will also work on a community update once the test repo is ready. Another
  sync up has been scheduled between Ezio and the SC on March 29th.

- The Steering Council discussed renaming the master branch to main and the
  consensus was that we should do that. The group is going to discuss the
  timeline and how to approach this with other repositories under the Python
  organization in some future meeting.

- The Steering Council discussed the Debian situation. The group discussed ways
  to approach the situation and how to coordinate with Debian maintainers so it
  can benefit the Python community at large. It was decided that the steering
  council will email the Debian maintainers to try to reach some common ground
  and discuss how to proceed.
