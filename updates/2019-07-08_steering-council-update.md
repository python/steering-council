# Steering Council Update


## Date: 2019-07-08

Steering Council updates will be posted irregularly and as needed.
We provide these updates to foster open and transparent communication about
Steering Council activity. We strive to post at least once every month.


# Message from the Steering Council

Sorry we've been silent for a while! With PyCon in Cleveland, the Language
Summit, Sprints, PEP activity, and a Python 3.8 beta release, it's been a busy
and productive May and June. Thank you all for your contributions. Below are
some of the outcomes of our weekly Steering Council conversations.

## Mandate

This section organizes Steering Council (SC) activity and projects
using the mandates listed in PEP 13.


### Language

> Maintain the quality and stability of the Python language and CPython interpreter

- Inspired by Russell Keith-Magee's PyCon keynote about Black Swan events, the
  Steering Council is looking at what may impact Python for the next
  decade. We have been discussing this within the Steering Council and writing
  up some thoughts on major challenges facing Python. We'll continue to edit
  and polish this vision document and share it when we are ready for wider comment.


### Contributors

> Make contributing as accessible, inclusive, and sustainable as possible

- **Communications channels:** We are very pleased with the move of
  python-dev, etc. to Mailman 3. We now have a modern UI and easy search across
  mailing lists.

  Just a reminder to recap where announcements and conversations are taking place:

  - To reach core committers specifically, we will use
    python-committers@python.org.

  - To reach the entire Python developer community, we will use
    python-dev@python.org.

  - For specific requests to the SC (e.g., PEP reviews), please use
    our public GitHub tracker at https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues.

  - To reach just the SC, you can email us at
    steering-council@python.org.

  - We will also occasionally use Discourse, at
    https://discuss.python.org (for example, Discourse is useful for
    polls and votes).


### PEPs

> Establish appropriate decision-making processes for PEPs

- To request a PEP review, please file an issue on the
  [SC issue tracker](https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues).

PEP highlights include:

- PEP 570, "Python Positional-Only Parameters", by Larry Hastings, Pablo
  Galindo and others. *Appointed Guido van Rossum as BD.* "Completed."
- PEP 574, "Pickle protocol 5 with out-of-band data", Antoine Pitrou.
  *Appointed Nick Coghlan as BD.* "Marked Final."
- PEPs 576, 579, 580, 590 (competing PEPs on C function call optimizations by
  Mark Shannon and Jeroen Demeyer; note that PEP 576 is withdrawn in favor of
  PEP 590). *Appointed Petr Viktorin as BD.* "Accepted 590."
- PEP 578, "Python Runtime Audit Hooks", Steve Dower.
  *Appointed Christian Heimes as BD.* "Landed, about to be marked Final."

- Discussing PEPs in Threads Listed in the `Post-History` Header
  - Review the PEP's `Post-History` header for discussion threads.
  - Discuss PEPs in the appropriate threads to gather community feedback and insights.
  - Emphasize the importance of community feedback and discussion.


### Interaction with PSF

> Formalize and maintain the relationship between the core team and the PSF

- We began discussions about fundraising ideas for CPython projects and administrative support.

- A [donation page]([https://www.python.org/psf/donations/python-dev/](https://www.python.org/psf/donations/python-dev/))
 was created by the PSF and was linked from the
 [CPython repo]([https://github.com/python/cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython)). Any funds that are donated will be used for Core Developers to attend the core development sprints (to start; future possibilities are dependent on the amount of funds gathered).

- At the Steering Council's recommendation, the PSF also is looking at hiring a Project Manager to manage communication and
  some logistics for the 2020 Python 2.7 End of Life.

- The PSF Code of Conduct Workgroup is working on a revision of the CoC and
  its approval by the PSF board. Brett and Carol serve on the Workgroup.


### Governance

> Seek consensus among contributors and the core team before acting in a formal capacity,

> Act as a "court of final appeal" for decisions where all other methods have failed.

- The weekly SC meeting cadence (Tuesdays 3-4pm US West Coast time) has been
  working out well.
