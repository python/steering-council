# Steering Council Update

Date: 2019-02-26

_Steering Council updates will be posted twice a month (shortly after
Steering Council meetings). We provide these updates to foster open and
transparent communication about Steering Council activity._

## Message from the Steering Council

**Ready to steer.** We've just wrapped up our first Steering Council video conference. To keep things moving forward, we've scheduled biweekly calls to discuss items under the Steering Council's mandate. To keep you informed about what we're working on, we'll publish updates, similar to this one, twice a month.

Our highest priority is **restarting the PEP review process**. We are taking a
look at all open and draft PEPs by our next meeting in mid-March. After this meeting, we'll update you on next steps for PEP 580 and others.

We're very pleased to see **contributing becoming more inclusive and accessible**. Thanks Terry and Victor for mentoring and supporting Cheryl Sabella, our newest core developer. Congratulations!

-- Barry, Brett, Carol, Guido, Nick
