# Steering Council Community Update for January - October 2020


## January recap:

- New Steering Council members were given appropriate access, brought up to
  speed on meeting flow, and given updates on the GitHub migration plan and
  vision document. Exiting Steering Council members were removed from GitHub
  and mailing list. Thomas and Victor will read through past documents and
  links to catch up.

- With regards to the Vision Document, Thomas brought up the importance of
  considering different implementations when talking about Python's future.
  Carol and Brett brought up work groups and how this may be the solution
  for such focused work.

- Steering Council discussed Ewa's question about handling interview
  requests that the PSF receives. It was decided that these requests would
  get [posted in the public Steering Council
  repo](https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues) as issues.

- The group discussed how it will deliver the vision plan at PyCon. It was
  decided one person would deliver the slides and then a group Q&A would
  happen.

- The group discussed getting core devs involved in the Vision planning and
  settled on doing a survey. Brett created a draft, which was eventually
  [sent out to
  python-committers@](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-committers@python.org/thread/XJ373N2H5O2OXMEQEEGYIIZ3U7RNHVHJ/#XJ373N2H5O2OXMEQEEGYIIZ3U7RNHVHJ)

- The group discussed the importance of packaging and how the Steering
  Council can help. Brett mentioned the Packaging Summit at PyCon and stated
  that the Steering Council should attend to see how it can help.

- The group discussed inactive core developers, as defined by PEP 13, and
  how to model the process without disenfranchising people.

- Victor briefly discussed the issue of backward compatibility breakages in
  3.9.

- Steering Council discussed PEP 613 (explicit type aliases)’s
  pronouncement.

- Ewa gave an update on GitHub migration and it was decided we would take
  the approach of an open "request for resumes" phase. Ewa is still waiting
  to hear back on financial support.

- With regards to the GitHub migration, the group briefly discussed how
  batch closing open issues may work and whether closed bugs should be
  migrated. Nothing was decided.


## February recap

- The Steering Council reviewed all open PEPs.

- The Steering Council briefly discussed the core dev survey and it was
  decided Ewa would send a reminder to core devs on February 10th.

- The Steering Council discussed documentation governance and it was decided
  Thomas would ask Ned B. to talk to Mariatta and see if he can work with
  Carol on a presentation for the Language Summit. Later, Carol gave an
  update of the documentation discussion and the idea of having an editorial
  group may help. Everyone Carol has discussed this idea with, thinks it is
  a good idea.

- Ewa proposed we create a Work Group for the GitHub migration project. Ewa
  will work on a charter.

- Steering Council discussed how to address core developers taking ownership
  of certain projects and how we can better improve tooling to help prevent
  these kinds of hurdles.

- Steering Council accepted PEP 584 (add union operators to dict). Barry is
  notifying Guido.

- Steering Council reviewed the core developer survey results. The next
  steps are to figure out how to structure paid development. Ewa is going to
  discuss with Ernest to see if he is interested in Project Managing this.

## May recap:

- The Steering Council discussed Eric's question about PEP 554 (multiple
  Interpreters in the stdlib). It was decided Victor would loop in Antoine
  and send SC motivations.

- Steering Council discussed the Minimum Viable Python WG. The SC agrees the
  WG should concentrate on defining the requirements for claiming/validating

  for Science](https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/essential-open-source-software-for-science/)
  grant process and potential projects: https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/26

- The Steering Council did a review of all open PEPs and assigned each other
  follow-ups.

## July recap:

- Steering Council (minus Thomas, per CoC WG recommendation) discussed the
  PEP 8 threads on python-dev and python-ideas, and the CoC WG’s
  recommendations. Steering Council decided that it will send the CoC WG's
  recommended shared statement to all core developers reminding them of the
  code of conduct (once it is approved by PSF and CoC WG). Additionally, the
  SC discussed a 3 month ban for one of the core developers. SC drafted the
  email to the individual and then the Steering Council will notify
  python-committers@ of the temporary ban as well. The plan is that Ernest
  will be removing the individual from access to certain platforms.

- Steering Council discussed how the joint Code of Conduct statement can be
  made and arrangements were made for the emails to be sent from
  steering-council@ instead of anyone's individual email address (same for
  the email to the individual receiving the 3-month ban). Group discussed
  and decided how the 3 month ban will be executed.

- The group discussed https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/26
  and decided on core dev in residence & single binary distributions.

  https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/31 and that no changes
  need to be made to the Dev Guide

- SC agreed to make Guido PEP delegate for PEP 604 (complementary syntax for
  Union[]).


## August recap:

  must stay involved in the CoC enforcement business otherwise things will
  not improve. Thomas, on behalf of the SC, is going to check in on the
  author of the PEP 8 commit message.

- The group discussed PEP 622 (structural pattern matching) and decided to
  leave comments in a Google Doc, subsequently shared with the PEP authors.
  The PEP authors joined a Steering Council call to discuss feedback of the
  PEP and how it can move forward.

  drafted a response and submitted it to [the open
  issue](https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/34)

- SC provided input to the PSF Funding WG for the CZI grant request, which
  was subsequently sent in.

  still plans on documenting what can be called Python or a subset of
  Python.

- Group discussed 2020 SC Elections: we will use the same timeline and same
  process as last year. Ernest will add Joe as election co-administrator.

- Ewa updated the SC on GitHub Migration work: Ezio created a GitHub
  Project. Ezio will want to join a future SC meeting to discuss how to best
  approach transparency. Additionally, we discussed the need to document how
  we can move our data elsewhere if ever needed in the future. Ewa has
  shared this sentiment with Ezio.
